# MovieBag
My web application is designed to provide users with comprehensive information about movies and series, sourced from an open API. Also suggests popular movies and TV shows for the current period, as well as top-rated content. Users have the ability to sign up and log in securely, thanks to authentication and authorization systems. The application allows users to search for their favorite movies and series, and store them in their personal library. Here, they can not only save their favorite shows but also rate them, providing valuable feedback.
In addition to personal libraries, users can create watchlists for movies and series they intend to watch. This feature helps users keep track of their viewing plans and discover new content. To enhance user experience, the application includes a feature that allows users to switch between three distinct color themes. This color theme switcher adds a personalized touch, making the application more visually appealing and user-friendly.
